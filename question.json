        "Modularity",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correct": "Modularity",
      "explanation": "Software code should be written in a clear, succinct, and easy-to-understand way. Simplicity should be preserved in the program code’s organization, implementation, and design. These codes should be constructed in such a way that software components (such as files and functions) are readily available. The software may be broken down into numerous parts to make it easier to comprehend and troubleshoot."

      "choices": ["Validation", "Specification", "Development", "Dependence"],
      "correct": "Dependence",
      "explanation": "A software dependency is an external independent library that can range in size from a single file to numerous files and directories arranged into packages to accomplish a specified purpose and is an attribute and not an engineering activity for process."

        "project management that emphasizes no progress"
      ],
      "correct": "project management that emphasizes incremental progress",
      "explanation": "Agile scrum methodology is a style of project management that emphasizes incremental progress. Each iteration is divided into two to four-week sprints, with the goal of completing the most important features first and delivering a possibly deliverable product at the end of each sprint."
